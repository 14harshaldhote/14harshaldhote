## About Me

I am a full-stack engineer specializing in designing and implementing **secure, scalable, and modular software systems**.  
My engineering philosophy emphasizes:

- Clean, maintainable architecture  
- Data security and privacy-oriented development  
- Modular design for performance and long-term sustainability  
- Intelligent automation and high-accuracy data processing  
- Building systems that scale with real organizational workflows  

I work extensively across backend, frontend, DevOps, and systems engineering layers to create robust digital platforms that support complex organizational needs.

## What I Do

### Software Architecture & Engineering
- Design modular, high-performance web architectures
- Convert monolithic systems into scalable multi-service platforms
- Implement enterprise-grade workflows with role-based structures

### Secure Backend Engineering
- Build high-integrity APIs with Spring Boot, Django, and Flask  
- Enforce strong authentication using JWT, encrypted sessions, and RBAC  
- Apply privacy-first patterns including CSRF protection, sanitization, and permission-driven access

### Process Automation & Intelligent Systems
- Develop OCR-powered data pipelines using OpenCV and Tesseract  
- Handle large-scale data processing with Celery, Redis, and asynchronous workers  
- Build accuracy-focused automated extraction and validation systems  

### Frontend Engineering
- Create fast, modular interfaces using React (Vite), Redux, and reusable component architecture  
- Optimize UI performance with reduced re-renders and clean state management  

### DevOps & Cloud Engineering
- Containerize services using Docker for reproducible deployments  
- Work with cloud-native stacks such as Kubernetes and AWS  
- Optimize databases using SQL indexing, caching, and transactional integrity principles
