## About Me

I am a backend and systems engineer with a strong focus on **secure application design**, **architecture development**, and **high-performance backend engineering**.  
My work centers around building platforms that are:

- security-hardened  
- scalable under real production workloads  
- modular and maintainable  
- automation-driven  
- privacy-compliant  

I work across backend services, workflow engines, infrastructure components, and intelligent data pipelines to deliver systems that organizations rely on for daily operations.

## What I Work On

### Architecture & System Design
- Design modular backend architectures for complex business workflows  
- Break down monolithic systems into structured, scalable components  
- Build permission-driven platforms supporting multi-role structures  

### Secure Backend Development
- Develop robust APIs using Spring Boot, Django, and Flask  
- Implement JWT authentication, encrypted sessions, and RBAC  
- Apply privacy-first design with CSRF protection, sanitization, and strict access layers  

### Data Automation & Intelligent Processing
- Build OCR and computer vision pipelines using OpenCV and Tesseract  
- Design high-throughput document processing systems  
- Use Celery, Redis, and async workers to handle large operations with stability  

### Interface & Frontend Logic
- Develop fast, modular interfaces using React (Vite) and Redux  
- Focus on performance optimization and clean state management  

### Platform Engineering & DevOps
- Containerize services using Docker for reproducible deployments  
- Work with cloud-native tools such as Kubernetes and AWS  
- Optimize SQL and caching layers for maximum system throughput
